Notes, to be sorted later- 

Many DSC resources will come in two flavors, a normal version and an 'x' version. Example being dsc_package and dsc_xpackage. The non-'x' version is the stable version, whereas the 'x' version introduces out-of-band functionality outside of what is included with the WMF installer.
